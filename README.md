### MER Plugin for EcoreTools GSLP Editor
This repository offers an integrated modeling event recorder into Ecore GLSP. It provides a web-based editor for Ecore Models (including Diagrams), with Eclipse Theia as the client. It contains two components: one GLSP language server (Server-side, written in Java) and one GLSP client extension to actually present the diagrams (Using Sprotty).
